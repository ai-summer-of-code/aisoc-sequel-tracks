# AISOC Season 1 Sequel Tracks
Sequel to the successful first edition of AISOC in 2024, and based on popular demand, we are opening the following specialist tracks to help you advance and specialize your knowledge and skill in specific areas of interest.
- Building Scalable Agentic Workflows
- Training, Serving and Scaling LLMs
- AI Systems in Production (Models, RAGs, Agents)

These tracks are largely independent of each other, however, they do have strict prerequisites as outlined in the next sections. Intending participants must ensure they meet these requirements.

**These tracks are not for complete beginners to AI or LLMs!**

## Building Scalable Agentic Workflows
