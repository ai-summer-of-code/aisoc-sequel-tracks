# AISOC Sequel Specialist Tracks, 2025
Sequel to the successful first edition of [AISOC in 2024](https://github.com/ai-summer-of-code/aisoc-season-1), and based on popular demand, we are opening the following specialist tracks to help you advance and specialize your knowledge and skill in specific areas of interest.
- [Building Agentic AI Systems](https://github.com/ai-summer-of-code/aisoc-sequel-tracks/#track-1-building-agentic-ai-systems)
- [Training, Serving, Scaling and Debugging LLMs](https://github.com/ai-summer-of-code/aisoc-sequel-tracks/#track-2-training-serving-scaling-and-debugging-llms)
- [AI Systems in Production (Models, RAGs, Agents)](https://github.com/ai-summer-of-code/aisoc-sequel-tracks/#track-3-ai-systems-in-production-models-rags-agents---coming-up-in-q2)

These tracks will run on separate timelines and can be taken independently. However, they do have strict prerequisites as outlined in their respective sections below. Intending participants must ensure they meet these requirements. All tracks come with community membership and post-training support.

**These tracks are not for entirely new comers to AI, ML or LLMs!**

**UPDATE:** We are adding a **community edition** track for beginners. This track is designed for those who missed AISOC Season 1 or want to build the fundamentals first, before diving into the specialist tracks. See [Track 0](https://github.com/ai-summer-of-code/aisoc-sequel-tracks/#track-0-aisoc-community-edition-for-beginners) for more details.

**NOTE:** Certifications and digital credentials will be issued at the end of these tracks.

## Track 0: AISOC Community Edition for Beginners
### Overview
This hands-on track is designed to recap the key foundational sessions from [AISOC Season 1](https://github.com/ai-summer-of-code/aisoc-season-1). This track will prepare you to meet the basic prerequisites for the 3 specialist tracks. This is a _community edition_ that will be primarily taught by brilliant, well-vetted community members who completed AISOC Season 1 and are doing exceptionally well already. These individuals will join the AISOC faculty to share their knowledge and guide you through the fundamentals.

### Track Details
- **Instructors:** Exceptional community members (TBA). Key sessions from the hosts.
- **Timeline:** February 22 - March 9, 2025 (Saturdays and Sundays only). Timetable to be shared soon.
- **Registration Deadline:** Februrary 15, 2025
- **Target Audience:** Beginers to LLMs or anyonw who wants to refresh their knowledge of the fundamentals before diving in to the specialist tracks. This includes data professionals, software engineers, ML engineers, etc.
- **Prerequisites:** Working knowledge of a programming language such as Python. Knowledge of APIs, cloud, and web frameworks will be a bonus, but not strictly required.
- **Delivery Mode**: Online only.
- **Learning Outcomes:** 
At the end of this track, participants will be equipped with the foundational knowledge required to prototype and implement LLM applications, including QnA systems, RAG systems, etc. This knowledge will also serve as a foundation for the specialist tracks outlined below.

## Track 1: Building Agentic AI Systems
### Overview
Hands-on technical training in the principles and best practices of designing and implementing LLM agents. This is a deep dive and build up on the following sessions on Agents from [AISOC Season 1](https://github.com/ai-summer-of-code/aisoc-season-1):
- [Introduction to Pydantic, Data Validation & Structured Outputs for LLMs](https://github.com/ai-summer-of-code/aisoc-season-1/tree/main/src/week_1/day_3_pydantic)
- [Turning LLMs into Agentic Systems](https://github.com/ai-summer-of-code/aisoc-season-1/tree/main/src/week_2/day_1_agents)
- [Building Conversational Web Search Agents](https://github.com/ai-summer-of-code/aisoc-season-1/tree/main/src/week_2/day_3_web_search/src/agent)

Sessions in this track will go well beyond the above and cover more indepth principles.
