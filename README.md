# AISOC Season 1 Sequel Tracks
Sequel to the successful first edition of [AISOC in 2024](https://github.com/ai-summer-of-code/aisoc-season-1), and based on popular demand, we are opening the following specialist tracks to help you advance and specialize your knowledge and skill in specific areas of interest.
- Building Agentic AI Systems
- Training, Serving, Scaling and Debugging LLMs
- AI Systems in Production (Models, RAGs, Agents)

These tracks will run on separate timelines and can be taken independently. However, they do have strict prerequisites as outlined in their respective sections below. Intending participants must ensure they meet these requirements.

**These tracks are not for beginners to AI, ML or LLMs!**

## Track 1: Building Agentic AI Systems
### Overview
Hands-on technical training in the principles and best practices of designing and implementing LLM agents. This is a deep dive and build up on the following sessions on Agents from [AISOC Season 1](https://github.com/ai-summer-of-code/aisoc-season-1):
- [Introduction to Pydantic, Data Validation & Structured Outputs for LLMs](https://github.com/ai-summer-of-code/aisoc-season-1/tree/main/src/week_1/day_3_pydantic)
- [Turning LLMs into Agentic Systems](https://github.com/ai-summer-of-code/aisoc-season-1/tree/main/src/week_2/day_1_agents)
- [Building Conversational Web Search Agents](https://github.com/ai-summer-of-code/aisoc-season-1/tree/main/src/week_2/day_3_web_search/src/agent)

### Track Details

**Timeline:** Februrary 28 - March 9, 2025

**Target Audience:** AISOC Season 1 graduates or anyone who has at least foundational knowledge prototyping LLM systems such as QnA systems and RAG. This track is not for beginers in AI or LLMs.

**Prerequisites:**
- Working knowledge of Python or similar programming languages.
- Familiarity with LLM APIs such as OpenAI, Gemini, Claude, etc, for prototyping.
- At least basic knowledge of prompt engineering
- **Prior knolwedge of Agents is helpful but not strictly required.**

## Track 2: Training, Serving, Scaling and Debugging LLMs
### Overview
Hands-on technical training in the inner-workings of large language models - from LLM architectures and training/finetuning techniques to deployment. You will learn how to pretrain LLMs on GPUs, finetune existing LLMs, serve LLMs based on infrastructure capacity or available compute, and finally how to optimise LLM servers using techniques such as distributed inference and server autoscaling.

### Track Details
**Instructors:** 
- [Zion Pibowei](https://linkedin.com/in/zion-pibowei) - Head of Data Science and AI, Periculum
- [Moses Daudu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/moses-daudu) - Senior AI Engineer, Awarri
- [Emeka Obiefuna](https://www.linkedin.com/in/donmonc) - Data Scientist, Univelcity
- [Saheed Azeez](https://www.linkedin.com/in/azeez-saheed) - AI Engineer, HelpMum Africa.
- Other instructors to be announced soon.

**Timeline:** March 21 - April 6, 2025

**Target Audience:** AISOC Season 1 graduates or anyone who has at least foundational knowledge prototyping LLM systems such as QA systems and RAG. This track is not for beginers in AI or LLMs.

**Prerequisites:**
- At least basic knowledge of prompt engineering
- Working knowledge of Python. Experience with Pytorch is a bonus.
- Familiarity with LLM APIs such as OpenAI, Gemini, Claude, etc, for prototyping.
- Previous experience training classical machine learning and deep learning models is a bonus but not compulsory.
- Familiarity with GPUs, CUDA and HuggingFace is a bonus!

**Delivery Mode**
- **Online:** Live sessions for ALL participants
- **In-person:** Bonus physical sessions on Saturdays to be held in Lagos for those interested. Venue and schedule TBA.

## Track 3: AI Systems in Production (Models, RAGs, Agents) - Coming up in Q2
### Overview
Hands-on technical training in the engineering best practices of implementing production AI systems and designing them for scale. This is a deep dive and more comprehensive treatment of the Production topics introduced in AISOC Season 1 Week 3. Prior knowledge to the level of most of the topics covered in AISOC Season 1 is expected as those sessions laid the necessary foundations across LLM training, APIs, RAGs, Agents and deployment. See an outline of the prerequistes in the next sessions for more details.

### Track Details
**Instructors:** 
- [Sam Ayo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sam-ayo) - Lead AI Engineer, Clive AI
- [Caleb Chinga](https://www.linkedin.com/in/calebchinga) - Engineering Manager, Periculum
- Other instructors to be announced soon.

**Timeline:** Q2 2025. Specific date TBA.

**Target Audience:** 
- AISOC Season 1 graduates or anyone with prior background in prototyping, training or finetuning LLMs, and who desire to build production-ready skills.
- Data/ML engineers, software engineers or developers from other fields with prior experience building and deploying traditional software, data pipelines or traditional ML systems.

**Prerequisites:**
- At least basic knowledge of prompt engineering
- Working knowledge of Python, C#/.NET, Go, Rust, Java or similar programming languages.
- Familiarity with LLM APIs such as OpenAI, Gemini, Claude, etc, for prototyping.
- General familiarity with Docker and cloud platforms is a bonus.
- Required familiarity in specialist areas:
  - **RAGs:** Prior knowledge of RAG implementation is REQUIRED for everyone, to the level covered in AISOC Season 1
  - **Agents:** For those mainly interested in productionizing agentic systems, prior knowledge in designing and implementing agents is required up to the level of the Agents track.
  - **Models:** For those interested in production systems (RAGs, Agents, QnA, etc) with bare/finetuned LLMs, prior knowledge in the inner workings of LLMs is required, up to the level of the Finetuning track.

### Delivery Mode
- **Online:** Live sessions for ALL participants.
- **In-person:** Bonus physical sessions on Saturdays to be held in Lagos for those interested. Venue and schedule TBA.
